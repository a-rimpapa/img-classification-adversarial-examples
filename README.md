# img-classification-adversarial-examples
A repository containing examples of adversarial machine learning for image classification in PyTorch.

Adversarial machine learning is .... The goal is to construct an image which a human can classify correctly, but which a neural network classifies wrongly.

An adversarial example is ...

- Chapter 7.13 of _Deep Learning_ by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville (available to read online [here](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/))

The neural networks used in the code are pretrained models available in the torchvision package (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html).
