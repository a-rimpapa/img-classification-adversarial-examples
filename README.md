# img-classification-adversarial-examples
A repository containing examples of adversarial machine learning for image classification in PyTorch.

TODO maybe change file main.ipynb to examples.ipynb and utils.py to main.py (only show examples in Jupyter notebook and have entire code in .py script file)

Adversarial machine learning is .... The goal is to construct an image which a human can classify correctly, but which a neural network classifies wrongly.

An adversarial example is ...

For more information about adversarial machine learning, see the following links:

- Chapter 7.13 of _Deep Learning_ by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville (available to read online [here](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/))

The neural networks used in the code are pretrained models available in the `torchvision` package (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html).

## Setup instructions
### Cloning the repository

To clone the repository using HTTPS, type the following command into a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/a-rimpapa/img-classification-adversarial-examples.git
```

... Alternative links for cloning or downloading the repository are at the top right of the page.

### Installing packages

* pip: Run `pip ... requirements.txt`
* conda: Run `conda ... environment.yml`

### Running the code

To run `main.ipynb`, start a Jupyter notebook server on your computer and open the notebook. This can be done for example by running `jupyter notebook` in the command line. ... (TODO other ways), or by using an IDE which automatically starts the notebook server.
